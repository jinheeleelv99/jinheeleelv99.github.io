<p style="color: #007acc;">
  Hi! I am Jinhee, currently seeking a Ph.D. position to explore research in computer vision, robotics, and biomedical AI for healthcare.
</p>

I have 3 years of hands-on experience working at a healthcare AI company, mainly focusing on AI-based skin diagnostics and dermatological analysis. I’m also participating in collaborative research projects related to surgical AI with the SIMI Lab at Stanford University and BAIL at Bongseng Memorial Hospital.

I received my Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Ohio State University. Before that, I worked in the aerospace engineering industry, focusing on supersonic combustion and aircraft engine research, after earning both my B.S. and my first M.S. in aerospace engineering. 

My research interests focus on AI systems that support surgeons during intraoperative decision-making and enhance preoperative diagnosis, using medical imaging and patient data. I’m also interested in surgical robotics, particularly in technologies that aim to improve surgical accessibility and safety.

<!-- My research interest is in computer vision and medical AI. I have experience in medical image segmentation and generative modeling, developed through both academic research and real-world industry work. I am particularly interested in building AI systems that support surgeons during intraoperative decision-making and enhance preoperative diagnosis using medical imaging and patient data. In addition, I am passionate about surgical robotics, especially the development of systems that enable safe, accessible surgeries in underserved or remote areas. -->
