<p style="color: #007acc;">
  I am looking for a Ph.D. opportunity to work on machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare.
</p>

I am currently working as an AI engineer at a healthcare startup in Korea, focusing on AI solutions for human skin analysis. 
In parallel, I currently participate in research projects as a research collaborator with Bongseng Memorial Hospital and the Stanford University Surgical Innovation & Machine Interface (SIMI) Lab, developing surgical AI applications for intraoperative neurosurgical procedures such as microvascular decompression (MVD).

 I received my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Ohio State University. Before that, I worked in the aerospace engineering industry, specializing in supersonic combustion and aircraft engine research. I earned both my B.S. and my first M.S. in this field.

My research interest is in computer vision and medical AI, and I have experience in medical image segmentation and generation through both research and real-world industry work. My ultimate goal is to develop medical AI systems that support surgeons in intraoperative decision-making. Preoperative diagnosis using medical imaging and patient data is one of my key research interests.
I also have a keen interest in surgical robotics, especially in developing systems that can deliver safe and accessible surgery to patients in underserved or remote areas.
